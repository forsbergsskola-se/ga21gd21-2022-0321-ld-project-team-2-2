Inside this PAD folder you will find the Lore and the Key lore.

I put them in specific folders for the user to know where they should hide the different
Lore Prefabs. 

Like this. 

1. Open - Lore Prefabs          ( Contains both types of lore )
2. Open - Hide at               ( Tells the user in what specifik area to hide the Lore ) 
3. Open - Specific area folder  ( Tells the user he or she is in the right folder for that specific area )

The key lore is assigned to be hidden at different objects within these specific areas.
See the Narrative Optional Document under ( Key Lore ) and the specific Key Lore prefab you are about 
to place out to know where to put it witin that area. 

For instance ** Cargo Key '' Should be hidden at a foot print ( witch we dont have ) so this 
one can be hidden pretty much anywhere but will lead the player to find the Key at the dawned aircraft.

While the ** Mountain Key ** should be found at the Rock monument AKA The runestone and lead the player 
up the Twins mountain. 


Hope this is readable, if not reach out to me for guidance!
